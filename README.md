# Traveller-Companion

## It's Dangerous Out There - Don't Go Alone

iOS app built in Swift with the purpose of being a companion to the Traveller Role Playing game. 

The idea behind the app is to reduce dice rolls required by the Referee and players, mostly around the trading mechanics.

## Phase 1:

 - Implement a list style app
   - When you add a new item, it generates a new system.
     - Default ability to swipe to delete an entry
   - Selecting an item opens up a details page for that system.
